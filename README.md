# Overview

`treepeat` is a tool that finds similarities in your codebase.

- Find **duplicate** code blocks meaningful to the language (classes/functions), not just lines (`--ruleset none`)
- Find **near-duplicates**, ignore whitespace, strings, high level AST nodes such as function and names (`--ruleset default`)
- Find **structurally similar** code, anonymizing identifiers, constants, etc (`--ruleset loose`)

Pull requests welcome: This is very much an proof of concept - I'm happy with it, but I haven't supported very many languages at present. PRs welcome!

Languages supported: astro, bash, css, go, html, javascript, lua, markdown, php, python, sql, typescript, java, kotlin, rust, yaml

## Usage

### Installation

```sh
pip install treepeat
```

### detect

Scan a codebase for similar or duplicate code blocks using tree-sitter AST analysis and locality-sensitive hashing.

Key flags:
- `--ruleset`: Normalization ruleset to use (`none`, `default`, `loose`) - controls how code is normalized before comparison
- `--similarity`: Percent similarity from 1-100 (default: 100 for exact duplicates)
- `--min-lines`: Minimum number of lines for a match (default: 5)
- `--diff`: Show side-by-side comparisons of similar blocks
- `--format`: Output format - `console` (default) or `sarif` for CI integration
- `--verbose`: Show additional run metrics, including per-stage timing when available
- `--progress`: Show progress bars for long-running pipeline stages
- `--verification-timeout`: Seconds allowed per candidate group (default: 30; 0 disables)
- `--max-group-pairs`: Maximum comparisons per candidate group (default: 100000; 0 disables)

```bash
# Find exact duplicates
treepeat detect /path/to/codebase

# Find near-duplicates with 80% similarity threshold
treepeat detect --similarity 80 /path/to/codebase

# Show diffs between similar blocks and use loose ruleset
treepeat --ruleset loose detect --diff --min-lines 10 /path/to/codebase

# Show parse progress and verbose stage timing
treepeat detect --progress --verbose /path/to/codebase

# Output results in SARIF format for CI tools
treepeat detect --format sarif -o results.sarif /path/to/codebase
```

`--progress` is intended primarily as interactive CLI feedback. The current implementation writes tqdm progress bars to `stderr`, leaving normal command output on `stdout` or `--output`.

For CI, see [resource limits, exit codes, and performance checks](docs/ci-performance.md).

### Other sub commands

#### list-ruleset

List all rules in a ruleset, along with their descriptions. Use `--language` to see which rules apply to a specific language.

#### treesitter

Display how treepeat normalizes source code into tree-sitter tokens for similarity detection -- helpful for debugging why a certain section of a file might be similar to another. Shows the original source code side-by-side with the normalized token representation.
